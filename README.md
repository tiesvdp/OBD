# ORDER BY DISORDER
Order By Disorder is a M4L plugin suite that allows the user to track moving objects in a video source and use it's positional data to generate notes or control plugin parameters.

Currently, these plug-ins are still in a primitive form and can only be applied in a limited number of situations; they are capable of detecting and tracking light or color differences. The aim is to further expand these plug-ins and add filters that give the user the option to base their object tracking on factors such as frame difference. With some adjustments, these plug-ins could be fully capable of recognizing, tracking, and outputting data from any moving object in any video source.

Keep an eye on this repo for updates!

## Installation
To download these plugins, follow these steps:
- Click on the green "Code" button on the top right of the repository.
- Click on "download ZIP".
- Unzip the downloaded folder.
- Just drag the plugins into your Ableton session!

I recommend creating a new MIDI track containing both the input and mothership plugin to handle the video processing on a single track.
